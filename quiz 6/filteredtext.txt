It laugh! For Click Irish marooned pirate's asteroid--their weapons single gun news-reel camera. [Transcriber's Note: This etext produced Planet Stories Spring 1944. Extensive research uncover evidence U.S. copyright publication renewed.] Suddenly, there. There time blink speak get scared. Click Hathaway's camera loaded stood listening rack-spin film fingers, knew getting damned sweet picture everything happening. The picture Marnagan hunched huge control-console, wrenching levers, jamming studs freckled fists. And dark fore-part space star-sprinkling meteor coming like blazing fury. Click Hathaway felt ship move like sensitive animal's skin. And meteor hit. It made spiked fist knocked rear-jets flat, ship spun like cosmic merry-go-round. There plenty noise. Too damned much. Hathaway knew picked hurled lever-bank, Marnagan long following, swearing loud words. Click remembered hanging camera gritting keep holding it. What sweet shot meteor! A sweeter one still Marnagan beating hell controls keeping words now. It got quiet. It got quiet could almost hear asteroids rushing up, cold, blue hard. You could hear heart kicking tom-tom sick stomach empty lungs. Stars, asteroids revolved. Click grabbed Marnagan nearest thing, held on. You came hunting space-raider ended cradled slab-sized Irishman's arms, diving hunk metal death. What fade-out! "Irish!" heard say. "Is IT?" "Is _what_?" yelled Marnagan inside helmet. "Is Big Producer yells CUT!?" Marnagan fumed. "I'll die I'm damned good ready. And I'm ready I'll inform picture profile Cosmic Films!" They waited, thrust shipside held hand gravity; listening other's breathing hard earphones. The ship struck, once. Bouncing, struck again. It turned end stopped. Hathaway felt grabbed; Marnagan rattled around--human dice croupier's cup. The shell ship burst, air energy flung out. Hathaway screamed air lungs, brain thinking quick crazy, unimportant things. The best scenes life never reach film, audience. Like one, dammit! Like _this_ one! His brain spun, racketing like instantaneous, flicking motions camera. * * * * * Silence came engulfed noise, ate swallowed it. Hathaway shook head, instinctively grabbed camera locked mid-belt. There nothing stars, twisted wreckage, cold pierced vac-suit, silence. He wriggled wreckage silence. He know found camera fingers grown born. He stood there, thinking "Well, I'll least good scenes film. I'll--" A hunk metal teetered, fell crash. Marnagan elevated seven feet bellowing manhood wreck. "Hold it!" cracked Hathaway's high voice. Marnagan froze. The camera whirred. "Low angle shot; Interplanetary Patrolman emerges unscathed asteroid crackup. Swell stuff. I'll get raise this!" "From toe boot!" snarled Marnagan brusquely. Oxen shoulders flexed inside vac-suit. "I might've died there, nursin' film-contraption!" Hathaway felt funny inside, suddenly. "I never thought that. Marnagan die? I took granted come through. You always have. Funny, think dying. You try to." Hathaway stared gloved hand, gloving thick heavy tell shaking. Muscles bony face went down, pale. "Where we?" "A million miles nobody." They stood middle pocked, time-eroded meteor plain stretched off, dipping silent indigo rash stars. Overhead, sun poised; black stars around it, making look sick. "If walk opposite directions, Click Hathaway, we'd shaking hands side rock two hours." Marnagan shook mop dusty red hair. "And I promised boys Luna Base time I'd capture Gunther lad!" His voice stopped silence spoke. Hathaway felt heart pumping slow, hot pumps blood. "I checked oxygen, Irish. Sixty minutes breathing left." The silence punctuated sentence, too. Upon sharp meteoric rocks Hathaway saw tangled insides radio, food supply mashed scattered. They lucky escaped. Or _was_ suffocation better death...? _Sixty minutes._ They stood looked one another. "Damn meteor!" said Marnagan, hotly. Hathaway got hold idea; remembering something. He said out: "Somebody tossed meteor, Irish. I took picture it, looked right eye rolled us, poker-hot. Space-meteors never hot glowing. If proof want, I've got here, film." Marnagan winced freckled square face. "It's proof need now, Click. Oxygen. And _food_. And way back Earth." Hathaway went saying thoughts: "This Gunther's work. He's somewhere, probably laughing guts job us. Oh, God, would make great news-release stuff ever get back Earth. I.P.'s Irish Marnagan, temporarily indisposed pirate whose dirty face never seen, Gunther name, finally wins triumphant finish. Photographed spot, color, truly, Click Hathaway. Cosmic Films, please notice." * * * * * They started walking, fast, pocked, rubbled plain toward bony ridge metal. They kept eyes wide awake. There much see, better standing still, waiting. Marnagan said, "We're working margin, got nothin' sweat except suspicions accident. We got fifty minutes prove right. After that--right wrong--you'll Cosmic Films prettiest unmoving, unbreathin' genius. But talk like, Click. It's times like need words, words, tongues. You got camera scoop. Talk it. As me--" twisted glossy red face. "Keeping alive hobby. And sort two-bit death I order." Click nodded. "Gunther knows hate dying way, Irish. It's irony clean through. That's probably planned meteor crash way." Marnagan said nothing, thick lips went corners, far down, green eyes blazed. They stopped, together. "Oops!" Click said. "Hey!" Marnagan blinked. "Did feel _that_?" Hathaway's body felt feathery, light whisper, boneless limbless, suddenly. "Irish! We lost weight, coming ridge!" They ran back. "Let's try again." They tried it. They scowled other. The thing happened. "Gravity act way, Click." "Are telling me? It's man-made. Better that--it's Gunther! No wonder fell fast--we dragged super-gravity set-up! Gunther'd anything to--did I say _anything_?" Hathaway leaped backward reaction. His eyes widened hand came up, jabbing. Over hill-ridge swarmed brew unbelievable horrors. Progeny Frankenstein's ARK. Immense crimson beasts numerous legs gnashing mandibles, brown-black creatures, tubular fat, others like thin white poisonous whips slashing along air. Fangs caught starlight white them. Hathaway yelled ran, Marnagan heels, lumbering. Sweat broke cold body. The immense things rolled, slithered squirmed him. A blast light. Marnagan, firing proton-gun. Then, Click's ears, Irishman's incredulous bellow. The gun hurt creatures all. "Irish!" Hathaway flung ridge, slid incline toward mouth small cave. "This way, fella!" Hathaway made first, Marnagan bellowing behind him. "They're big; can't get us here!" Click's voice gasped out, Marnagan squeezed two-hundred-fifty pounds beside him. Instinctively, Hathaway added, "Asteroid monsters! My camera! What scene!" "Damn damn camera!" yelled Marnagan. "They might come in!" "Use gun." "They got impervious hides. No use. Gahh! And pretty chase, eh, Click?" "Yeah. Sure. _You_ enjoyed it, every moment it." "I that." Irish grinned, showing white uneven teeth. "Now, uninvited guests door?" "Let think--" "Lots time, little man. Forty minutes air, exact." * * * * * They sat, staring monsters minute. Hathaway felt funny something; know what. Something monsters Gunther and-- "Which one having?" asked Irish, casually. "A red one blue one?" Hathaway laughed nervously. "A pink one yellow ruffles--Good God, got _me_ it. Joking face death." "Me father taught me; keep laughing Irish luck." That please photographer. "I'm Anglo-Swede," pointed out. Marnagan shifted uneasily. "Here, now. You're nothing sitting, looking like little boy locked bedroom closet, take profile shot beasties myself." Hathaway petted camera reluctantly. "What hell's use? All swell film shot. Nobody'll ever see it." "Then," retorted Marnagan, "we'll develop benefit; waitin' U.S. Cavalry come riding hill rescue!" Hathaway snorted. "U.S. Cavalry." Marnagan raised proton-gun dramatically. "Snap pose," said. "I paid salary trot along, photographing, hoped, capture Gunther, least record peace negotiations betwixt pixies." Marnagan fooling anybody. Hathaway knew superficial palaver nothing covering fast, furious thinking running around red-cropped skull. Hathaway played palaver, too, mind whirring faster camera spun picture Marnagan standing useless gun pointed animals. Montage. Marnagan sitting, chatting monsters. Marnagan smiling camera. Marnagan profile. Marnagan looking grim, without much effort, camera. And then, closeup thrashing death wall holed in. Click took all, shots, saying anything. Nobody fooled nobody act. Death near sweaty faces, dry mouths frozen guts. When Click finished filming, Irish sat save oxygen, used arguing Gunther. Click came back him: "Gunther drew us here, sure Ceres! That gravity change felt back ridge, Irish; proves it. Gunther's short men. So, what's do; builds asteroid-base, drags ships down. Space war perfect yet, guns prime true space, trajectory lousy long distances. So what's best weapon, dispenses losing valuable, rare ships small bunch men? Super-gravity couple well-tossed meteors. Saves around. It's good front, damned iron pebble. From it, Gunther strikes unseen; ships simply crash, that's all. A subtle hand, aces." Marnagan rumbled. "Where dirty son, then!" "He appear, Irish. He sent--them." Hathaway nodded beasts. "People crashing die air-lack, food, wounds caused crackup. If survive that--the animals tend them. It looks like Nature responsible. See subtle attack is? Looks like accidental death instead murder, Patrol happens land finds us. No reason undue investigation, then." "I see Base around." * * * * * Click shrugged. "Still doubt it? Okay. Look." He tapped camera spool popped onto gloved palm. Holding up, stripped full twenty inch length, held light developed, smiling. It one best inventions. Self-developing film. The first light struck film-surface, destroyed one chemical, leaving imprints; second exposure simply hardened, secured impressions. Quick stuff. Inserting film-tongue micro-viewer camera's base, Click handed whole thing over. "Look." Marnagan put viewer helmet glass, squinted. "Ah, Click. Now, now. This one lousy film invented." "Huh?" "It's strange process'll develop picture ignore asteroid monsters complete." "What!" Hathaway grabbed camera, gasped, squinted, gasped again: Pictures montage; Marnagan sitting down, chatting conversationally _nothing_; Marnagan shooting gun _nothing_; Marnagan pretending happy front _nothing_. Then, closeup--of--NOTHING! The monsters failed image film. Marnagan there, hair like red banner, freckled face blue eyes bright it. Maybe-- Hathaway said it, loud: "Irish! Irish! I think I see way mess! Here--" He elucidated Patrolman. About film, beasts, film wrong. If film said monsters there, there. "Yeah," said Marnagan. "But step outside cave--" "If theory correct I'll it, unafraid," said Click. Marnagan scowled. "You sure beasts radiate ultra-violet infra-red something come film?" "Nuts! Any color _we_ see, camera sees. We've fooled." "Hey, _you_ going?" Marnagan blocked Hathaway smaller man tried pushing past him. "Get way," said Hathaway. Marnagan put big fists hips. "If anyone going anywhere, it'll going." "I can't let that, Irish." "Why not?" "You'd going say-so." "Ain't say-so good enough me?" "Yes. Sure. Of course. I guess--" "If say animals ain't there, that's I need. Now, stand aside, film-developing flea, let Irishman settle bones." He took unnecessary hitch trousers exist except inch porous metal plate. "Your express purpose voyage, Hathaway, taking films used Patrol later teaching Junior Patrolmen act tough spots. First-hand education. Poke another spool film contraption give profile scan. This lesson number seven: Daniel Walks Into The Lion's Den." "Irish, I--" "Shut load up." Hathaway nervously loaded film-slot, raised it. "Ready, Click?" "I--I guess so," said Hathaway. "And remember, think hard, Irish. Think hard. There animals--" "Keep focus, lad." "All way, Irish." "What say...? Oh, yeah. Action. Lights. Camera!" Marnagan held gun front still smiling took one, two, three, four steps outside world. The monsters waiting fifth step. Marnagan kept walking. Right middle them.... * * * * * That sweetest shot Hathaway ever took. Marnagan monsters! Only Marnagan. No monsters. Marnagan smiled smile broader shoulders. "Hey, Click, look me! I'm one piece. Why, hell, damned things turned tail ran away!" "Ran, hell!" cried Hathaway, rushing out, face flushed animated. "They plain vanished. They imaginative figments!" "And think let hole us way, Click Hathaway, coward!" "Smile say that, Irish." "Sure, ain't I always smilin'? Ah, Click boy, tears sweet grey eyes?" "Damn," swore photographer, embarrassedly. "Why put window-wipers helmets?" "I'll take Board, lad." "Forget it. I blamed glad see homely carcass one hunk, I help--Look, now, Gunther. Those animals part set-up. Explorers land inadvertently, chased back ships, forced take off. Tourists like. Nothing suspicious animals. And tourists leave, animals kill them." "Shaw, now. Those animals can't kill." "Think not, Mr. Marnagan? As long believed could frightened us death, forced us, maybe, commit suicide. If dangerous--" The Irishman whistled. "But, we've got _move_, Irish. We've got twenty minutes oxygen. In time we've got trace monsters source, Gunther's Base, fight way in, get fresh oxy-cannisters." Click attached camera mid-belt. "Gunther probably thinks we're dead now. Everyone else's fooled playmates; never chance disbelieve them." "If taking pictures, Click--" "Coupled damned stubborn attitude accident--" Click stopped felt insides turning water. He shook head felt film slip eyes. He spread legs steady himself, swayed. "I--I think oxygen full yours. This excitement double-breathing I feel sick." Marnagan's homely face grimaced sympathy. "Hold tight, Click. The guy invented fish-bowls provide sick stomach." "Hold tight, hell, let's move. We've got find animals came from! And way get animals come back!" "Come back? How?" "They're waiting, outside aura thoughts, believe again, they'll return." Marnagan like it. "Won't--won't kill us--if come--if believe 'em?" Hathaway shook head tons heavy weary. "Not believe _certain point_. Psychologically seen felt. We want _see_ coming us again." "_Do_ we, now?" "With twenty minutes left, maybe less--" "All right, Click, let's bring 'em back. How it?" Hathaway fought mist eyes. "Just think--I see monsters again. I see I feel them. Think over." Marnagan's hulk stirred uneasily. "And--what I forget remember that? What I get excited...?" Hathaway answer. But eyes told story looking Irish. Marnagan cursed. "All right, lad. Let's it!" The monsters returned. * * * * * A soundless deluge them, pouring rubbled horizon, swarming malevolent anticipation two men. "This way, Irish. They come way! There's focal point, sending station telepathic brutes. Come on!" Hathaway sludged pressing tide color, mouths, contorted faces, silvery fat bodies misting plowed them. Marnagan making good progress ahead Hathaway. But stopped raised gun made quick moves it. "Click! This one here! It's real!" He fell back something struck down. His immense frame slammed rock, noiselessly. Hathaway darted forward, flung body Marnagan's, covered helmet glass hands, shouting: "Marnagan! Get grip, dammit! It's real--don't let force mind! It's real, I tell you!" "Click--" Marnagan's face bitter, tortured movement behind glass. "Click--" He fighting hard. "I--I--sure now. Sure--" He smiled. "It--it's shanty fake!" "Keep saying it, Irish. Keep up." Marnagan's thick lips opened. "It's fake," said. And then, irritated, "Get hell me, Hathaway. Let feet!" Hathaway got up, shakily. The air helmet smelled stale, little bubbles danced eyes. "Irish, _you_ forget monsters. Let handle them, I know how. They might fool again, might forget." Marnagan showed teeth. "Gah! Let flea fun? And besides, Click, I like look them. They're pretty." The outpour animals came low lying mound mile farther on. Evidently telepathic source lay there. They approached warily. "We'll taking chances guard," hissed Irish. "I'll go ahead, draw attention, maybe get captured. Then, _you_ show _your_ gun...." "I got one." "We'll chance it, then. You stick I see what's ahead. They probably got scanners out. Let see me--" And Hathaway could object, Marnagan walked off. He walked five hundred yards, bent down, applied fingers something, heaved up, door opening rock. His voice came back across distance, Click's earphones. "A door, air-lock, Click. A tunnel leading inside!" Then, Marnagan dropped tunnel, disappearing. Click heard thud feet hitting metal flooring. Click sucked breath, hard fast. "All right, put 'em up!" new harsh voice cried different radio. One Gunther's guards. Three shots sizzled out, Marnagan bellowed. The strange harsh voice said, "That's better. Don't try pick gun now. Oh, you. I thought Gunther finished off. How'd get past animals?" Click started running. He switched _sending_ audio, kept _receiving_ on. Marnagan, weaponless. _One_ guard. Click gasped. Things getting dark. Had air. Air. Air. He ran kept running listening Marnagan's lying voice: "I tied pink elephants Gunther's neat alphabetical bundles stacked dry, ya louse!" Marnagan said. "But, damn you, killed partner chance!" The guard laughed. * * * * * The air-lock door still wide open Click reached it, head swimming darkly, lungs crammed pain-fire hell-rockets. He let in, quiet soft. He weapon. He weapon. Oh, damn, damn! A tunnel curved, ending light, two men silhouetted yellow glare. Marnagan, backed wall, helmet cracked, air hissing slowly it, face turning blue. And guard, proton gun extended stiffly him, also vac-suit. The guard profile toward Hathaway, lips twisting: "I think I'll let stand right die," said quietly. "That Gunther wanted, anway. A nice sordid death." Hathaway took three strides, hands front him. "Don't move!" snapped. "I've got weapon stronger yours. One twitch I'll blast whole damned wall behind you! Freeze!" The guard whirled. He widened sharp eyes, reluctantly, dropped gun floor. "Get gun, Irish." Marnagan made move, crumpled clumsily forward. Hathaway ran in, snatched gun, smirked guard. "Thanks posing," said. "That shot go film history candid acting." "What!" "Ah: ah! Keep place. I've got real gun now. Where's door leading Base?" The guard moved head sullenly left shoulder. Click afraid would show weak dizziness. He needed air. "Okay. Drag Marnagan you, open door we'll air. Double time! Double!" Ten minutes later, Marnagan Hathaway, fresh tanks oxygen backs, Marnagan fresh bulger helmet, trussed guard, hid huge trash receptacle. "Where belongs," observed Irish tersely. They found complete inner world; asteroid nothing honey-comb fortress sliding void unchallenged. Perfect front raider little equipment short-handed men. Gunther simply waited specific cargo ships rocket by, pulled knocked swarmed cargo. The animals served simply insure suspicion swarms tourists filled void days. Small fry wanted. They scared off. The telepathic sending station animals great bank intricate, glittering machine, strips colored film images slid slots machine mouths translated thought-emanations. A damned neat piece genius. "So are, still much better were," growled Irish. "We ship space-radio, guards'll turn moment. You think could refocus doohingey, project monsters inside asteroid fool pirates themselves?" "What good would do?" Hathaway gnawed lip. "They fool engineers created them, nut." Marnagan exhaled disgustedly. "Ah, U.S. Cavalry would come riding hill--" * * * * * "Irish!" Hathaway snapped that, face lighting up. "Irish. The U.S. Cavalry is!" His eyes darted machines. "Here. Help me. We'll stage everything colossal raid century." Marnagan winced. "You breathing oxygen whiskey?" "There's one stipulation I make, Irish. I want complete picture Marnagan capturing Raider's Base. I want picture Gunther's face it. Snap it, now, we've got rush work do. How good actor you?" "That's silly question." "You three things. Walk gun front you, firing. That's number one. Number two clutch heart fall dead. Number three clutch side, fall twitch ground. Is clear?" "Clear Coal Sack Nebula...." An hour later Hathaway trudged passageway led sort city street inside asteroid. There six streets, lined cube houses yellow metal, ending near Hathaway wide, green-lawned Plaza. Hathaway, weaponless, idly carrying camera one hand, walked across Plaza owned it. He heading building pretentious enough Gunther's quarters. He got halfway felt gun back. He resist. They took straight ahead destination pushed room Gunther sat. Hathaway looked him. "So Gunther?" said, calmly. The pirate incredibly old, bulging forehead stood sunken, questioningly dark eyes, scrawny body lost folds metal-link cloth. He glanced paper-file, surprised. Before could speak, Hathaway said: "Everything's with, Mr. Gunther. The Patrol city we're capturing Base. Don't try fight. We've thousand men eighty-five." Gunther sat there, blinking Hathaway, moving. His thin hands twitched lap. "You bluffing," said, finally, firm directness. "A ship landed hour. Your ship last. Two people it. The last I saw pursued death Beasts. One escaped, seemed." "Both. The guy went Patrol." "Impossible!" "I can't respect opinion, Mr. Gunther." A shouting rose Plaza. About fifty Gunther's men, lounging carved benches time-off, stirred feet started yelling. Gunther turned slowly huge window one side office. He stared, hard. The Patrol coming! Across Plaza, marching quietly decisively, came Patrol. Five hundred Patrolmen one long, incredible line, carrying paralysis guns tight hands. Gunther babbled like child, voice shrill dagger air. "Get there, men! Throw back! We're outnumbered!" Guns flared. But Patrol came on. Gunther's men run, Hathaway credit that. They took it, standing. Hathaway chuckled inside, deep. What sweet, sweet shot was. His camera whirred, clicked whirred again. Nobody stopped filming it. Everything wild, hot angry. Gunther throwing fit, still seated desk, unable move fragile, bony legs atrophied state. Some Patrol killed. Hathaway chuckled saw three Patrolmen clutch hearts, crumple, lie ground twitch. God, photography! Gunther raged, swept small pistol linked corselet. He fired wildly Hathaway hit head paper-weight. Then Hathaway took picture Gunther slumped desk, chaos taking place immediately outside window. The pirates broke fled, left. A mere handful. And chaos came Marnagan's voice, "Here!" * * * * * One Patrolmen stopped firing, ran toward Click Building. He got inside. "Did see run, Click boy? What idea. How do?" "Fine, Irish. Fine!" "So here's Gunther, spalpeen! Gunther, little dried pirate, eh?" Marnagan whacked Hathaway back. "I'll hand you, best plan o' battle ever laid out. And proud I fight splendid men these--" He gestured toward Plaza. Click laughed him. "You proud. Five hundred Patrolmen hair like red banners flying, thick Irish brogues broad shoulders freckles blue eyes body tall stories!" Marnagan roared. "I always said, I said--if ever could army Marnagans, could lick whole damn uneeverse! Did photograph it, Click?" "I did." Hathaway tapped camera happily. "Ah, then, scoop you, boy? Money Patrol use film instruction Classes money Cosmic Films news-reel headlines! And scene, acting! Five hundred duplicates Steve Marnagan, broadcast telepathically minds pirates, walking across Plaza, capturing whole she-bang! How like death-scenes?" "You're ham. And anyway--five hundred duplicates, nothing!" said Click. He ripped film-spool camera, spread air develop, inserted micro-viewer. "Have look--" Marnagan looked. "Ah, now. Ah, now," said over. "There's Plaza, there's Gunther's men fighting they're turning running. And running from? One man! Me. Irish Marnagan! Walking across lawn, paralyzing them. One hundred, cowards running me! "Sure, Click, better I thought. I forgot film register telepathic emanations, Marnagans. It makes look like I'm mighty brave man, not? It does. Ah, look--look me, Hathaway, I'm enjoying every minute it, I am." * * * * * Hathaway swatted back-side. "Look here, egocentric son Erin, there's work done. More pirates captured. The Patrol still marching around someone might suspicious looked close saw red hair." "All right, Click, we'll clean rest now. We're combination, two, are. I take back pictures, Click, thought taking pictures inserting telepath machines we'd dead ducks now. Well--here I go...." Hathaway stopped him. "Hold it. Until I load camera again." Irish grinned. "Hurry up. Here come three guards. They're unarmed. I think I'll handle fists change. The gentle art uppercuts. Are ready, Hathaway?" "Ready." Marnagan lifted big ham-fists. The camera whirred. Hathaway chuckled, himself. What sweet fade-out was!
